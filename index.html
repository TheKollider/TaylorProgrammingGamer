I've been playing video games for as long as I remember and I knew I wanted to work in the industry of making them. This is my private patch of internet in which I store my portfolio, hope you enjoy!</p>

				<h2>PREVIOUS PROJECTS</h2>
				<div class="line-header"></div>
				<p>In this project, we were given a an empty tank, with the task to use AI steering behaviours and pathfinding to create an AI tank capable of moving and switching behaviours based on its environment. Below is a little demonstation of the work I produced. All of this was achieved with C++, with the graphics engine being SDL, as the graphics side wasn't the focus of this project, that AI was. </p>

				<p>This project was a team based project, in which 5 of us had to create any game we wanted in 12 weeks, which we then had to go on to demonstrate this to the senior programmers at Ubisofts studio in Leamington Spa. My role in the project was to handle the design of the levels, and to have the entire map be proceedurally generated. I also had a hand in getting the wall hopping mechanic working for the movement. Take a look below to see the result!</p>

				<p>Below is a little project I did working with the DirectX libraries for a graphics demonstation. The video below shows the use of multiple cameras, which can move on seperate from each other. Other features are correctly programmed lighting of all ambient, diffuse and specular. Enjoy!  </p>
