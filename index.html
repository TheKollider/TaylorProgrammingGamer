                         Gaming took over my life when I was old enough to hold a PlayStation 1 controller without throwing it around. Ever since I have experienced games on multiple platforms growing up

                                        development with small amounts of C++ as well. Coordinated and
                                        collaborated with numerous projects to help meet their needs and integrate
                                        them into our tool. Contributed to CI/CD efforts with creating releases and

                                        the properties panel to handle objects in the world on the engine side. On the game side I gathered assets and designed the map including organising all the collisions and map.
                                        The project was entirely built upon a DirectX 11 viewport and the UI was handled by the library Dear ImGui.

                                        Our group of 5 decided on a game which would mix parts of games we found fun such as Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfares PC deathrun Mod and the game Speedrunners
                                        to amalgamate our concept. My role in the group was to produce the map sections and to procedurally generate them in random orders and stitch 
                                        them together to form a the map. I also played a role in helping the double jump part of the movement system. All work was done using Unreal Engine 4 and our group used 
                                        a shared GitHub repository as our platform for version control.

                                     Below is a little demonstration of the work I produced. All of this was achieved with C++, with the graphics engine being SDL, as the graphics side wasn't the focus of this project, that AI was.

                                        a new API first. Below is a video showcasing the methods implemented.

                                        I thought it would be a great idea to follow the same procedure, but then finally implement that onto Unreal Engine as it is the same
